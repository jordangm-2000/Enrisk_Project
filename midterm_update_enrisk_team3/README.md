# Team 3 - GraphFault Event Sequence Analysis

## Project overview
Several aviation accident analytics methods and according EDA: severity prediction to event sequence modeling using LSTMs, Transformers and Markov transition graphs.

## Folder structure
- `reports/`: Midterm report
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory data analysis and deep learning analytics.

## Setup instructions
1. Ensure `mdb-tools` is installed (`brew install mdbtools`).
2. Install dependencies: `pip install tensorflow xgboost pandas`.
3. Place `avall.mdb` in your local directory (Note: data is not included in this repo).

## Team contributions
- **Jordan:** LSTM model architecture and result visualisations.
- **Matt:** EDA, Transformer and Markov back-off model architecture and result visualisations.
